# HaarCascadesWithOpenCV
This is a python project where you can use live cameras and use python to recognize objects using OpenCV2 and Haar Cascades. The code for this was based off and taken from tutorials (and Stack Overflow). I had to make some minor tweaks to get it up and running on my machine. The XML is taken directly from tutorials as this is where we will get Haar Cascade from. Please read and visit andrewssobral's github (linked below) for a detailed and information packed explaination of Haar Cascades.

I will detail what is needed to get this up and running below:
